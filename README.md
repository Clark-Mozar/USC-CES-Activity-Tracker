The CES (Community Extension Services) Activity Tracker is a website for the University of San Carlos - Talamban Campus, School of Engineering and for the Office of the Community Extension Services. It is part of my research project and the reason why me and my research team made this is that it is a requirement for an engineering student to have 60 CES points in order for them graduate and in order for them to get 60 CES points is for the students to attend any CES-related events. 

The problem within the School of Engineering is where students do not know any events given by the Office of the CES and that the students do not how many CES points they garner. The website works like this:

The CES coordinator or the CES representative posts a CES event (A CES event is a school activity where students and/or faculty members of the university share or their knowledge and learnings to community, it can range from tree planting, feeding programs, webinars or seminars, and workshops). Later, a student visits the website and scans for any CES event/s they want to join. Once they can find one, the student registers into that event and participates on that said event. Once the event ends, the student are required to submit their reflection paper, certificate of participation, and photos where they participated on the event where the CES representative will grade them based on their submission, roles they are assigned on the event (event leader, resource speaker, or participant), and their attendance.
